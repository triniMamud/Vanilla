# Vanilla JS \ CLONES

## 1
Create a function that stacks n clones behind the a target element.
This function should create and append each clone behind the target, while assigning a background color following
the order of a static array of colors.

## 2
Clones will be displayed when the user clicks the main container.
Once the click is fired, clones should move down stacking one below the other on a single column.
A video reference is provided with the desired behaviour.


### RULES:
* HTML should NOT be edited.
* LIBRARIES ARE NOT ALLOWED. Only good old js.
* Clones amount is an integer value.
* Color array can have any number of colors declared.
* Color order must be followed.


### TIPS:
* Use the video as reference, it's just more simple to understand.
* JS and CSS are both aviliable to edit, use it!
* If you have questions related to the challenge, just ask.
